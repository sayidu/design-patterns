Third Party Gem Selection: Rails
======

__Deciding on a Gem__
* Is there a language supported way of implementing what is required?.
ie. Is a third party library necessary?
* What would be the most optimised way to implement a solution for this?
* What are the popular community gems for addressing the usecase?

__Selected a Gem__
* How long has the selected gem being in existence?
* Is the gem being maintained?. ie. How quickly are bugs addressed?
* Will it be best to fork the repo and make changes or add-ons?. ie. Do you need to introduce the entire gem codebase to your application.

__Using the Gem__
* Stick with the version you have once you have selected a version. ie. Upgrade to a new version of the gem cautiously.

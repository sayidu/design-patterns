2. **If you decided a third party library is necessary. Consider the following:**

    *a.* What are the popular community libraries for addressing the usecase?

3. **Select your top 3 library options, by asking the following questions:**

    *a.* How long has the selected library being in existence?

    *b.* Is the library being maintained?.

    *c.* How quickly are bugs addressed?

4. **When deciding on which of your top 3 options to go ahead with, end with the following
    questions.**

      *a.* How well do these library options solve the problem?

      *b.* Do you need to introduce the entire library codebase to your application?

      *c.*  Will it be best to fork the repo and make changes or add-ons?.

__Using the Library__
* Stick with the version you have once you have selected a version.
  ie. Upgrade to a new version of the library cautiously.

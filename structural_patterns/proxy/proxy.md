# Proxy Pattern

  __Intent__
 Provide a placeholder for another object control access to it.

 __Problem__
 We require more control over how and when a object is being accessed.

 __Solution Approaches__
 Protection Proxy: Implements access control before an object is accessed.
 Remote Proxy: Provide a local representative for an object in a different
 address space.
 Virtual Proxy: it delays the creation of an object until it is used.
